## Introduction

Welcome to "The Most Annoying Cookie Consent" project! In just 5 hours of dedicated development, I've crafted a cookie consent experience that's memorable, perhaps even a tad bit irritating, but fear not ‚Äì your precious data is in the safest hands.

## Project Overview

This project is a showcase of my journey into the world of web development, where I explored various concepts and techniques while creating the ultimate cookie consent mechanism. Here's what I achieved:

- **Delayed Modal Magic**: Leveraging the power of the `setTimeout` function, I orchestrated a perfectly timed appearance of the cookie consent modal. Your consent won't go unnoticed!

- **Styling Sorcery with `element.style`**: Using `element.style`, I dynamically transformed the appearance of elements to give the cookie consent a distinct and eye-catching look.

- **Data Handling with `formData`**: I embraced the magic of `formData` to efficiently handle and process data, ensuring a seamless interaction between your choices and the consent process.

- **Class Toggle Frenzy**: Through skillful class toggling, I brought the cookie consent to life, making it the most animated and interactive part of your browsing experience , inspiration : scrimba!
